# 🏥 How Satisfied Are Patients with Their Hospitals?
A Tableau Dashboard on U.S. Hospital Patient Experience

This project explores patient satisfaction across more than 3,000 hospitals in the United States, using publicly available data from the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS). The goal was to clean, analyze, and visualize healthcare survey data to gain meaningful insights into hospital performance and patient experience.

## 📌 Project Objectives
Understand how patient satisfaction varies across different hospitals and states.

Analyze how factors such as hospital type, location, and ownership affect patient feedback.

Build an interactive Tableau dashboard that allows users to explore the data and uncover trends.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
SQL – for data cleaning and preparation

Tableau – for visualization and dashboard development

HCAHPS Dataset – publicly available from Medicare.gov

## 📁 Key Features of the Dashboard
Bar chart displaying patient satisfaction scores by state and hospital size

Scatter Plot comparing overall hospital ratings with satisfaction scores

Dynamic Filters to explore by state and hospital type

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Process
The raw HCAHPS dataset was cleaned and transformed using SQL. This involved:

Filtering for relevant survey measures

Handling missing or null values

Aggregating satisfaction scores by hospital and state
